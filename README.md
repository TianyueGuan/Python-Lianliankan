# Python-Mahjong
This is our python final project.
It is a picture matching game. There are 3 levels in the game, which are different difficulties, the default level is the easiest one. Different levels have different game times and help times. There are 5 buttons, they can increase difficulty, reduce difficulty, restart the game, give the tips, and quit the game.
If players can connect two pairs of the same pattern with no more than 3 straight lines, the patterns can be eliminated successfully, and total game time will increase by two seconds. Eliminating all pairs on the board within the specified time, you win; otherwise, you will lose the game.
